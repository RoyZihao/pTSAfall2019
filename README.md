### Overview
This graduate level course presents fundamental tools for characterizing data with statistical dependencies over time, and using this knowledge for predicting future outcomes. These methods have broad applications from econometrics to neuroscience.The course emphasizes generative models for time series, and inference and learning in such models. We will cover range of approaches including Kalman Filter, HMMs, AR(I)MA, Gaussian Processes,  and their application to several kinds of data.

Note: information presented is tentative, syllabus may be subject to change as course progresses.

### Grading
problem sets (25%) + midterm exam (25%) + final project (25%) + lab(20%)+participation(5%)

Participation: piazza, engagement during lectures, labs, and office hours

### Piazza 
We will usePiazzafor announcements, and discussions about the course. Interactions on Piazza, particularly good answers to other students' questions, will count toward the participation grade.

### Projects
Work in groups of 2-3 students.* Topics are flexible, including applying know algorithms to an interesting dataset, reviewing and implementing a state of the art solution, to improving an existing algorithm. Project proposals due in week 4. *Check with CS if you are considering working individually or in a larger group.

### Online recordings 
Lecture videos will be posted to NYU Classes. Class attendance is still required.

### Academic honesty

We expect you to try solving each problem set on your own. However, if  stuck  you should discuss things with other students in the class, subject to the following rules:
  - Brainstorming and verbally discussing the problem with other colleagues ok, going together through possible solutions, but should not involve one student telling another a complete solution.
  - Once you solve the homework, you must write up your solutions on your own.
  - You must write down the names of any person with whom you discussed it. This will not affect your grade.
  - Do not consult other people's solutions from similar courses.

#### *Policies*
Try to solve problems on your own first. If you get stuck, you can discuss homework questions with colleagues, but you need to write up the final solution individually.  Credit should be explicitly given for any code you use that you did not write yourselves.Late submission penalties: 20% points off for each extra day of delay.
